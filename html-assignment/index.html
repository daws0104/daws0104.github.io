                <p>I have an interest for many nerdy things. I’ve played video games since childhood and spend lots of time with them. Though this will only be my {2} year playing I have put many days worth of hours into the {MMO-RPG} {FF14}. Also I have recently gotten into {TTRPGs} like dungeons and dragons. 53</p>
                
                <p>My other big interest is art. I love to draw weather it be with a sketchbook or a tablet. {My art is heavily influenced my the media I’ve experienced}. For a long while I’ve been working on a personal project which is a multi-part comic series. {Making my own characters and stories is has been a fulfilling creative endeavor.}</p>
