                <p>I have an interest for many nerdy things. I’ve played video games since childhood and spend lots of time with them. Though this will only be my 2<sup>nd</sup> year playing I have put many days worth of hours into the <abbr title="massively multiplayer online role-playing game">MMO-RPG</abbr> <addr title="final fantasy 14">FF14</addr>Also I have recently gotten into <abbr title="Table top role-play game">TTRPG</abbr>  like dungeons and dragons.</p>
                
                <p>My other big interest is art. I love to draw weather it be with a sketchbook or a tablet. <em>My art is heavily influenced by the media I’ve experienced.</em> For a long while I’ve been working on a personal project which is a multi-part comic series. <em>Making my own characters and stories has been a fulfilling creative endeavor.</em></p>
